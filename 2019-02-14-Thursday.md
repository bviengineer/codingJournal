# Today's Journal

## [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)
Today is not a designated build day but I wanted to get some work done on [my version of the Frontend Mentor Huddle page](https://bviengineer.github.io/frontendmentor.io-huddle-landing-page/index.html) challenge. I recreated 99% of page based on the mock-up and is almost read to scale it up to desktop. It's currently optimited for 375px or iPhone 6.

**PAIN-POINT:** the gradient decorative image at the top of the top-right of the page presented a challenge and after resarching and various tricks, it's time to ask for help from the Frontend Mentor slack community.

## [Treehouse TalentPath]()
Resumed TalentPath track, Python module and the lessons focused on loops. 
* Built two CLI-based apps
  * One that checked for the correct password and used `import sys` for the use of the exit method to quit the program after several unsuccessful login attempts.
  <br>

  * The other iterated through a string to find specific words or letters inside of the string.
  <br>

* Completed a challenge that asked a user for their name and to answer yes or no to whether they knew what loops are.
  * If the answer was no, the app explained and repeated the question until the user answered yes, at which time, it would congratulate the user for understanding what loops are.

## [Node JS Tutorial by The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp)
I have used node.js in the past. A trusted source recommended this playlist for Node.js and since it's organized and promises to take an in-depth look at Node.js and Chrome v8, it will not hurt to go through it.
* Started with video #1 - Introduction to what Node.js is.
