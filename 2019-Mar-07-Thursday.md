## [Treehouse]()
Resumed JavaScript and the DOM lessons and covered.
* `.removeChild(element here);`
* A quiz and a challenge covering removing elements from the DOM
* Events in JavaScript
  * The browser responds to events through `functions`
* **Function statements or declaration** contains all properties, methods and behavior of a JavaScript `Function Object`. They are hoisted to the top of the enclosing function or global scope and can be used before it's declared.
  ```Javascript
    say("JavaScript") // output => JavaScript

    function say(something){
      console.log(something)
    }
  ```
* **Function expressions** the name can be omitted from the function which creates an `anonymous function` and can be usd as an `IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)` that runs as soon as it's defined.
  ```JavaScript
    exec(function /*function name was omitted here */(something){
      console.log(something)
    }, "JavaScript")

    // 0R

    var exec = function /*function name was omitted here */ (something){
      console.log(something);
    };
  ```
