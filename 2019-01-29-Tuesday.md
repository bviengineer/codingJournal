Today was filled with catching up on days worth of journal notes and other commitments. However, below is what I managed to squeez in.

## [FreeCodeCamp [FCC]](https://freecodecamp.org)
Worked on the last few CSS Grid lessons and covered:
* Reducing the repetition when defining columns and rows by using the `repeat()` function
<br>

* Limiting the size of grid items when the parent container size changes, using `minmax function` by setting the minium & maximum size ranges
<br>

* Using `auto-fill` to create flexible layouts and automatically create rows and columns. It is part of the `repeat()` function 
<br>

* Using `auto-fit` to also create flexible layouts.  It removes empty rows or columns and stretches the grid items to fit the size of the grid container. It too can be used with the `repeat()` function
<br>

* Using `media queries` to change the `grid` layout based on the screen size
<br>

* Creating nested `grids` (grids within grids)

This concludes the CSS Grid lessons. Next up are five responsive web design projects, two of which, I've already completed and is considering redoing or revamping. Upon successful completion of the projects, it will render a responsive web design certificate. Just a note, my speedy completion of the responsive web design module is as a result of prior FCC work (before the current changes or during the old curriculm).
