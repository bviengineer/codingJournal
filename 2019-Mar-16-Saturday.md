>>>># DAY OFF! :moon::sunny::smile:
I typcally rest on the weekends but decided to watch a few tutorials doing some housework. 
<hr>

## [Lynda](htps://lynda.com)
* Looked at the Android Development course on [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com); no software installation took place.

## [Udacity](https://udacity.com)
Reviewed the Shell workshop lesson and the following commands:
* `echo` - used print messages back to the developer 
and is like `console.log` in JavaScript.
<br>

* `ls` - list contents of the current directory
* `ls <folder_name>` - list content of the specified folder
* `cd ..` - changes the director up to the parent director
* `;` or `ls ; cd ..` - a semicolon allows you to list more than one command to be executed. They are executed one at a time in the order listed.
