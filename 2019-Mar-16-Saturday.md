I typcally rest on the weekends but decided to watch a few tutorials doing some housework. 
<hr>

## [Lynda](htps://lynda.com)
* Looked at the Android Development course on [Lynda.com](https://lynda.com); no software installation took place.

## [Udacity](https://udacity.com)
Reviewed the Shell workshop lesson and the following commands:
* `echo` - used print messages back to the developer 
and is like `console.log` in JavaScript.
