# Today's Journal

## [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)
Today is not a designated build day but I wanted to get some work done on [my version of the Frontend Mentor Huddle page](https://bviengineer.github.io/frontendmentor.io-huddle-landing-page/index.html) challenge. I recreated 99% of page based on the mock-up and is almost read to scale it up to desktop. It's currently optimited for 375px or iPhone 6.

**PAIN-POINT:** the gradient decorative image at the top of the top-right of the page presented a challenge and after resarching and various tricks, it's time to ask for help from the Frontend Mentor slack community.

## [Treehouse TalentPath]()
Resumed TalentPath track, Python module and the lessons focused on loops. 
* Built two CLI-based apps
  * One that checked for the correct password and used `import sys` for the use of the exit method to quit the program after several unsuccessful login attempts.

  * The other iterated through a string to find specific words or letters inside of the string.
