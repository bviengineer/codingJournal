### [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io)
Last build day, I built out the body of the mobile version of the **Frontend Mentor Huddle Page intermediate-level challenge**. Thus far today, I have built out the footer section of the mobile version of the page. If you can recall [from the previous build day](https://github.com/bviengineer/codingJournal/blob/master/2019-Feb-06.md), I took a mobile-first approach to this project.

One of the biggest challenges I ran into building out the footer was changing the color of the image to all white. Unlike text, the color of an image cannot simply be modified by setting the css color property. Drawing from the recent [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) lessons on **Applied Visual Design**, I was familiar with the concept and thus knew what to research. Ultimately, removing the sturation from the image, inverting the unsaturated image by about 50% and then brightening the image, transformed the its appearance in close resembalance to that of the mock up. 
```css
  filter: saturation(0) invert(50%) brightness(900%);
```

You can view the project by clicking on [this link](https://bviengineer.github.io/frontendmentor.io-huddle-landing-page/index.html) and remember, this is built for device width of 375px. I'll be working on the desktop version of site shortly.
