###### Though spring break began a bit early for me, commencing last week, it's NOW officially spring break and I'm trying to sneak in some learning and coding where possible, even if for a few minutes, so that my routine doesn't get too far out of hand.

**Mondays** are typically build days for me.:clap::star2: - _will try to sneak that in too_; just a little. :smile:
