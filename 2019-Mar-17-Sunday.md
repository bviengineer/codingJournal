Resumed review git of on [Udacity](https://udacity.com). Looked over the following concepts:
* `git branch` - used to interact with `git branches` and can
  * list all branch names in a given repository by just typing `git branch` without flags
  * create new branches by typing `git branch <desired-branch-name>`
  * delete branches
<br>

* `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch to the desired branch
