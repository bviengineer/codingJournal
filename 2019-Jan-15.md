## FreeCodeCamp [FCC]
Continued on the topic of Applied Accesibility and covered five (5) lessons.
* Standarizing times using ``datetime`` attribute inside of the ``<time></time>`` tag
  ```html
    <time date="2019-01-15">Tuesday, January 15th, 2019</time>
  ```
* Using custom CSS to make content visible to screen readers only, as in the case of a chart that needs to be presented alternatively in a table format, for visually impaired users.
  <br> 

* Using high contrast text to improve readability of text by a minimum of 4.5 to 1 (4.5:1) contrast ratio as recommended by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html).
  <br>

* **Ensure the sufficient use of contrast** in consideration of colorblindness keeping in mind that, color should not be the single source of communicating important information, and the background and foreground colors should have sufficient contrast in order to be distinguished by users who are colorblind. 
  <br>

* **Selectively choose colors to convey important information** by avoiding the use of neighboring colors on the color wheel, which may not provide enough contrast for colorblind users to be able to distingusih the information.
