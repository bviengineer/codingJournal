Continued on Loops, Arrays and Objects, quizzes and challenges. A challege to build a siple quiz using JavaScript was comleted. 

```JavaScript
// Practice Challnge
var correctAnswers = 0;
var incorrectAnswers = 0;
var message = "";
var correctQuestions = [];
var incorrectQuestions = [];

var quiz = [
	['How many days are in a week?', 7],
	['How many months are in year?', 12],
	['How many days are in a non-leap year?', 365],
	['How many weeks are in a year?', 52],
	['How many months have 31 days?', 7],
];

for(var i = 0; i < quiz.length; i++){
	var answerPrompt = parseInt(prompt(quiz[i][0])); //questions at index 0 is prompted for an answer
	
	if(answerPrompt === quiz[i][1]){ //comparing user answer to the answer in position 1 of each inner array
		correctAnswers += 1;
		correctQuestions.push(quiz[i][0]);
	} else {
		incorrectAnswers += 1;
		incorrectQuestions.push(quiz[i][0]);
	}
}

//turns array items into <ol>
function listQuestions(array){
	var olList = "<ol>";
	for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
		olList += "<li>" + array[i] + "</li>";
	}	
	olList += "</ol>";
	return olList;
}

//prints message to html page
function print(message) {
  var messageDiv = document.getElementById("output");
	messageDiv.innerHTML = message;
}

message = "<p>You answered: <strong> " + correctAnswers + "</strong> question(s) correctly </p>"; 
message += "<p><strong>You answered the following questions correctly: </strong></p>" + listQuestions(correctQuestions);
message += "<p><strong>Research these questions: </strong></p>" + listQuestions(incorrectQuestions);

print(message);
