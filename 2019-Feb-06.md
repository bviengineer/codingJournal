 Today was the first of many planned and dedicated [_build days_](), days set aside to build-out projects, work on challenges and apply the theoretical learning through practice work.

# [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io)
Worked on styling and aligning body elements for the Frontend Mentor Huddle Page challenge. My progress can be found on the [corresponding github repository](https://bviengineer.github.io/frontendmentor.io-huddle-landing-page/index.html). It's a work in progress so all critiques should abstain until completion.

The page is being built using the mobile-first approach and thus in its current state is suited for a mobile device at 375px.

# [FreeCodeCamp [FCC]](https:/freecodecamp.org)
Currently on the **Responsive Web Design Projects** Certification section of the curriculum. Since my [previous Tribute page](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/GZwVEY) was completed prior to the implementation of the new requirements, I redid the page using the current specifications or user stories. [The updated tribute page](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/pGdNxP) on the life of **Garrett A. Morgan**, can be found on CodePen. As per the instructions, it was forked from [the project example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx) provided.

# [Service Workie](https://serviceworkies.com/)
To recap on service workers, resumed use of [service workie](https://serviceworkies.com/) and completed level 5 and some of level 6. Web app is extremely slow on my device and thus, wasn't able to get to the end of level 6 after 1.5 hours of using the web app.
