## [App Academy Online FREE Full-Stack Curriculum](https://open.appacademy.io) - REVIEW
It has been two weeks since I last touched the App Academy Curriculum and a result, I refreshed my memory on what I previously learned.
 
* **Printing data** using: `puts`, `print` or `p`
  * `print` does minimal formatting without adding a new line
    ```ruby
    print "Hello"
    print "World"

    # Output
    HelloWorld

    # Note: to print automatically decend to a new line using print, a \n will be required at the end of the string like this:

    print "Hello \n"
    print "World"

    # Output
    Hello 
    World
    ``` 
* `puts` does some formatting and adds a new line
  ```ruby
  puts "Hello"
  puts "World"

  # Output
  Hello
  World
  ```
* `p` prints data with a new line and provides information about the type of data printed
  ```ruby
  p "Hello"
  p "World"
  p 2019

  # Output
  "Hello" # i.e. string
  "World" # i.e. string
  2019  # i.e. number
  ```
<br>

* How to write comments: `#`
<br>

* **Numbers**
  * equality operator `==` returns a boolean: `true` or `false`
  * not equal `!=` returns a boolean `true` or `false` 
  * greater than eual to `200 >= 100` returns a boolean, `true` or `false`
  * less than equal to `200 <= 100` reuturns a boolean, `true` or `false`
  <br>

* **Math Operators**
  * `+` - addition
  * `-` - substriction
  * `/` - division
  * `%` - modulas returns the remainder of a division problem
  <br>
 
* **Strings** 
  * are placed within qutation marks single `''` or double `""`
  * can have their length checked using `.length`
    ```ruby
    puts "Ruby".length

    # Output
    4
    ```
  <br>

  * finding the index position of a character in a string using square brackets `[]`. **Indexes begin at 0**.
    ```ruby
    puts "Ruby"[0]
    puts "Ruby"[3]
    # Output
    R
    y
    ```

  * `+` concatenates strings or puts them together
    ```ruby
      puts "Hello " + "World"

      # Output
      Hello World
    ```
