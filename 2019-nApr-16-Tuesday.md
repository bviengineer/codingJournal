Today was another build day. I continued from where I left off yesterday on the [Build a Product Landing Page](https://bviengineer.github.io/build-a-product-landing-page/); project #3 of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design Project.  

The site is currently passing 14 out of 16 tests. Or, unofficially 15 out of 16 tests?! One of the test is falsely failing for which I have submitted an issue.

In doing this project, I would say I spent the most time on getting the layout correct. Despite having it written down the approach I wanted to take, it required adjustments along the way.

The project still has some minor fixes that are needed but for the majroity of it is completed.

## Advanced CSS Course on YouTube
I took some time to seek out advanced CSS courses and located a course by [Harshad Rupawate](https://youtu.be/ZBw5hWy4hs4) titled: [The Most Advanced CSS Course - Natours Project Setup and First Steps Part 1](https://youtu.be/ZBw5hWy4hs4). 

In this course I learned about the `clip-path` property. This is a new property to me and I have begun a deeper dive.
