# Coding Journal
This repository will serve as written documentation of what is covered during my personal study and learning times. It's a personal journal that I am choosing to share, simply because, as a life-long learner, actual time spent learning may not be actually represented on GitHub, and if you carefully ponder, is not the single source of truth of how I, or anyone who is consistently leveling-up, spend their time. 

Outside of pushing code to GitHub, time is spent on tutorials and other coding platforms that typically host your code and as a result, there is no pushing of code to GitHub. This can go on for days or weeks at a time.  Does that then mean that an individual hasn't been coding or learning? No, not necessarily. Hence, the coding journal. To document the time spent elsewhere, learning, reading, trying code samples, watching tutorials, leveling-up.

## Indirect Benefits of Journaling my Journey 
* It helps me gauage how well I grasp what I have learned
* I get to the opportunity improve my markdown knowledge
