Used little time I had and worked on the header portion of my [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) [Product Landing Page](https://github.com/bviengineer/build-a-product-landing-page). This is currently a private repository and thus, is currently unsure if my progress will be visible to all else.
