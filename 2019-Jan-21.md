## FreeCodeCamp [FCC]
Today's journey began with FCC and with the topic of _CSS Flexbox_. Concepts covered were:
* Use `display: flex;` to position two boxes
* Add `flex` to a tweet embed
* Use of `flex-direction` to make a row
* Apply the `flex-direction` property to create rows for the tweet embed
* Use `flex-direction` property to make a column
* Apply the `flex-direction` property to create a column in the tweet embed
* Align elements using the `justify-content` property

## App Academy [free] Full-Stack Curriculm
Still on the Arrays module, I picked up on a challenge it appears I completed but don't quite remember doing so nor do I have it journaled as completed; but it does look like my work so, yeah!:tada:

To fill in the missing documentation, will list it here for simplicity.
* method that return odd #s only
* method that reutrn words with more than 4 characters

Since there wa a small amount of challenges remaining in the array module, I decided to complete the section.:tada. Next time, I'll begin with a new module, _Arrays and Enumerables_; how exciting! For now, these challenges were completed:
* wrote a method that accepts an array of words and returns a new array consisting of words from the original array that are longer than 4 charaters.:heavy_check_mark:
<br>

* wrote a method that accepts two arrays, return a new array consisting of the results of summing corresonding elements of the initial arrays.:heavy_check_mark::heavy_check_mark:
  * so that basiaclly looked like this
  ```ruby
    def add_corresponding( [arr1], [arr2] ) 
      code here    
    end 

    puts add_corresponding( ["hello", "coding"], ["world", "is fun"] ) #["Helloword"], ["codingisfun"]
   
   # In the event nubers were passed into both arrays, there would have been mathematical calculations instead of concatenations.
    # This challenge also assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that both arrays were the same length.
  ```
  * wrote a fizz buzz method that accepts a parameter. The parameter represented the max number. The method returned a new array containing all numbers from 0 to the max (the parameter) that were either divisible by 4 or 6 but not divisible both simultaneously.:heavy_check_mark::heavy_check_mark::heavy_check_mark:
