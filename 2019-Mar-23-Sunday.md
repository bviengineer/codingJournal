## [CSS Grid on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE)
Continued review of CSS Grid on Scrimba. Worked through lessons on:
* Template areas
* Auto-fit and minmiax
* Implicit rows
* Image grid

Just a few more lessons to go. I"ve found that the best way to remember how to use CSS grid, is to build something using it!
