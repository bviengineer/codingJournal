## FreeCodeCamp [FCC]
Began today's lessons on FCC with the Introduction to Responsive Web Design Challenges and practiced:
* Creating media queries.

* Making an image responsive by setting the: 
```css
  width: 100%; 
  height: auto; 
  display: block;
```
<br>

* Setting the height & width of an image to half its original size for optimization on Retina displays.
<br>

* Making typography responsive using the following values preceded by a number: 
```css 
  vm: % of the viewport's width
  vh: % of the vieport's height
  vmin: % of the viewport's smaller dimension
  vmax: % of the viewports bigger dimension

  /* E.g: */

  p {
    width: 10vm;
  }
  h1 {
    width: 20vmin;
  }
```

## App Academy Online
Picking up where I left off; the **array module**, specifically, on the second half of a challenge which involved returning half of an array including up to the middle number in the event the array length was an odd number. 

I peaked at the solution and it was then I realized I had completely forgotten that in Ruby dividing by a whole number returns a whole number whether odd or even, but dividing by decimal yields a decimal. E.g.
```ruby
  puts 10 / 2 #5
  puts 10 / 2.0 #5.0
  puts 10 / 3 #3 Huh? shouldn't this be a deciaml? Yes! See below!
  puts 10 / 3.0 #3.3333333333333335
```

So instead of using a whole number like I was previously doing, adding a `.0` to the end of the divisor would have provisioned for arrays with an odd number in length.

* To give a bit more context to the explanation above and solution below, the challenge asked to: 
  * write a method that accepts an array as a parameter, returns a **new array** made up of at least the first 1/2 of elements in the original array and up to the middle element if the length of the array is odd.
```ruby
  def first_half(array)
    newArr = []
  
  i = 0  	
  while i < (array.length / 2.0)
  	newArr << array[i]
  	i += 1
  end
  return newArr
end

print first_half(["Peter", "James", "Elenor", "Stephanie"]) # => ["Peter", "James"]
puts
print first_half(["k", "l", "m", "n", "o"]) # => ["k", "l", "m"] 
#because at position 2 which is m, i would be equal to the length of the array when divided by 2.0, which is 3.333333333335

```
* The 2nd challenge involved writing a method that accepts a number as a parameter and returns an array of positive numbers that were <= the parameter, considering the parameter was divisible by the numbers in the array. 
```ruby
#Logic
  def factors(num)
	arr = []
	i = 1
  while i <= num
  	if num % i == 0
    	arr << i
    end
    i += 1
  end
  return arr
end

print factors_of(3)   # => [1, 3]
puts
print factors_of(4)   # => [1, 2, 4]
```

## Treehouse
I am working through a track in Treehouse that consist roughly of 18 hours of content on HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tools, JavaScript and practice sessions on:
* CSS Selectors
* CSS Floats
* The Box Model
* Media Queries

There is a 2-week timeline for completion which is near and today, I spent the rest of my day and evening working through the track so that it can be completed by the beginning of next week.

Topics covered include:
* Continued on the section, Understanding Values and Units
  * Em & Rem 
  * Color values
  * Text styles
  * Font properties
  * Line height
* The Box Model
  * Padding, borders, margins
  * Display values
