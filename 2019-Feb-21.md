Lists in Python contiued
* `copy()` method on a list makes a copy of the original list without modifyig its value
  ```python
  ```
<br>

* `join()` works with iterables but belongs to strings and is thus a string method. Turns lists into strings
  ```python
  ```
<br>

* `split()` turns strings into lists
  ```python
  ```
<br>

* `slice()`
  ```python
  ```
* `multidimentional lists === multidimentional arrays in JS`
  * built a simple CLI that calcuated the weeks' expenses by totaling expenses for each day of the week over the course of three weeks.
  ```python
    travel_expenses = [
      [5.00, 2.75, 22.00, 0.00, 0.00], #week1, m-f
      [24.75, 5.50, 15.00, 22.00, 8.00], #week2, m - f
      [2.75, 5.50, 0.00, 29.00, 5.00], #week3, m -f
  ]

  #print(travel_expenses)
  week_number = 1

  for week in travel_expenses:
      print("* Week #{}: ${}".format(week_number, sum(week) ))
      week_number += 1

  # Output
  # * Week #1: $29.75                                  
  # * Week #2: $75.25                                         
  # * Week #3: $42.25
  ```

* Worked on the module CLI app: __Shopping List App__ and the app can:
  * continuously prompt user for an item
  * provide instrutions on how to terminate app when done with the list
  * provide instructions on how to ask for help at anytime during the program
