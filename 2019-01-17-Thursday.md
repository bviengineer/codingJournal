## App Academy
It's close to midnight and trying to think through a problem while tired is ineffective. The answer to the first half of the challenge which is to write a method that accepts an array and returns the first half of the array, is correct.  The second half of the challenge which involves returning the first half of elements in an array including up to the middle element if the length of the array is an odd number, requires some thought on a rested brain, body and eyes. 
Signing off until tomorrow, God's willing.:pray:
