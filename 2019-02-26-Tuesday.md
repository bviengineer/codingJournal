## [Treehouse TalentPath]()
Continued review of the module on Loops, Arrays and Objects. Built two console applications that examined an array of objects made up of student records and printed the results to the page.

The first application looped through the list of array objects and printed each one to the page. 
```JavaScript
//Data structure of stuent records
var students = [
	{ 
		name: "Ronald T.", 
		track: "Database", 
		achievements: 100, 
		points: 10000
	},
	{ 
		name: "Kaisma T.",
		track: "Full-Stack Web Development",
		achievements: 200, 
		points: 2000
	},
	{ 
		name: "Kera T.",
		track: "Web Design", 
		achievements: 300, 
		points: 3000 
	},
	{ 
		name: "Levi T.", 
		track: "Back-End Development", 
		achievements: 400, 
		points: 1000 
	},
	{ 
		name: "Caleb T.", 
		track: "Data Science", 
		achievements: 500, 
		points: 5000 
	},
]
	
// Access each student record and print them to the screen.
// Records are to include the students
// name, track,  achievements & points

// Hold student record
var studentRecord = "";

// Prints student records to the page
function printStudentRecord(studentRecord){
	var output = document.getElementById("output");	
	output.innerHTML = studentRecord;
}

// Loops through array of student objects & builds each student record
for(var i = 0; i < students.length; i++){
	studentRecord += "<h4>Student: " + students[i].name + "</h4>";
	studentRecord += "<p><strong>Track:</strong> " + students[i].track + "</p>";
	studentRecord += "<p><strong>Achievements:</strong> " + students[i].achievements + "</p>";
	studentRecord += "<p><strong>Points:</strong> " + students[i].points + "</p>";
	studentRecord += "_________________________";
}	

printStudentRecord(studentRecord);

```

The second application presented a continous prompt that instructed to type a student name in order to search through the array of student objects and if located, print that particular record to the page.

```Javascript
//Data structure of stuent records
var students = [
	{ 
		name: "Ronald", 
		track: "Database", 
		achievements: 100, 
		points: 10000
	},
	{ 
		name: "Kaisma",
		track: "Full-Stack Web Development",
		achievements: 200, 
		points: 2000
	},
	{ 
		name: "Kera",
		track: "Web Design", 
		achievements: 300, 
		points: 3000 
	},
	{ 
		name: "Levi", 
		track: "Back-End Development", 
		achievements: 400, 
		points: 1000 
	},
	{ 
		name: "Caleb", 
		track: "Data Science", 
		achievements: 500, 
		points: 5000 
	},
]

// Hold student record
var studentRecord = "";

// Prints student record(s) to the page
function printStudentRecord(studentRecord){
	var output = document.getElementById("output");	
	output.innerHTML = studentRecord;
}

//TODO:
	// Students list should be searchable
	// Use prompt to accept seach string
	// return only matching student record
	// Have search prompt run continuosly 

do {
	printStudentRecord(studentRecord);
	var studentSearch = prompt("Type name of Student to search or EXIT to end the program:" ).toLowerCase();	
	console.log(studentSearch); //testing 
	for(var i = 0; i < students.length; i++){
		if(studentSearch.toLowerCase() === students[i].name.toLowerCase() ){
			studentRecord += "<h4>Student: " + students[i].name + "</h4>";
			studentRecord += "<p><strong>Track:</strong> " + students[i].track + "</p>";
			studentRecord += "<p><strong>Achievements:</strong> " + students[i].achievements + "</p>";
			studentRecord += "<p><strong>Points:</strong> " + students[i].points + "</p>";
		}
	}	
}	while(studentSearch.toUpperCase() !== "EXIT")
	
printStudentRecord(studentRecord);

```

## [Client Website]()
Created a private repo for and html structure for a client website. Work continues tomorrow.
