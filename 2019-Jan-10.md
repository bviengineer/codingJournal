### Free Code Camp [FCC]
Since successfully completing the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, I have reconvened studies at FCC. Why? To finish what I started and to keep a consistent habit of learning. Though some of the concepts are familiar, others well known, a second look helps to solidify concepts or learn conceputal idiosyncrasies that might have been missed or misunderstood.

**Applied Accessibility**
In today's lessons, I covered Accessibility pertaining to the following:
* Sharing audio content using the audio element ``<audio></audio>``
  * `<source />` is nested inside of `<audio></audio>` and requires two attributes:
    * `src=""` => the location of the audio file
    * `type=""` => the type of audio file 
  * There is a controls attribute that displays the default play/pause, volume features, when passed to the audio element. E.g. ``<audio controls></audio>``
  * ``<audio>`` needs a corresponding text transcript.  
    <br>

* Images and applicable content are markup using the ``<figure></figure>`` element along with related ``<figcaption></figcaption>`` nested inside of it, used like this:
    ```html
    <figure>
        <img src="location of content" alt="what the content is about">
        <figcaption>Caption for content</figcaption>
    </figure>
    ```

* The ``<label></label>`` is used to label form control elements and thus aid screen readers in indentifying selected form fields.   
    <br>

* Sorrounding a group of radio button elements using the ``<fieldset></fieldset>`` element and using ``<label for=""></label>`` with a `for` attribute to associate the label with the specific radio button item, using the `id` attribute of the radio button.
    <br>

* Using the HTML5-implemented _date picker_
    * I have personally benefited from this element when completing online forms and it's very convenient to have. However, it may not yet be supported across all browsers. 
        * [Can I use?](https://caniuse.com/#search=date%20picker) is a good resource to use in verifying implementation of specfications across various browsers.


**Take-a-way**
Using semantic tags is beneficial for screen readers as it makes a web application accessible for all to use. It also makes the markup more meaningingful and reduces the amount of labeling that would otherwise be required to make content accessible when typical ``<div></div>`` tags are used.

### TreeHouse
Took it back to basics with Treehouses' _HTML Basics_ course. Topics covered include:
* What is HTML
* Structure of HTML
* Common HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists and links
* Semantic HTML

### App Academy
App Academy is a software development bootcamp headquartered in San Francisco, California, who, in the latter part of 2018, generously made their full-stack development course availble online, at no cost to aspiring developers. The curriculum is identical to their in-person course. You can find the information [here](https://open.appacademy.io/) and in various articles through a quick [Google](https://www.google.com/) search.

Since my training is in Front-End Web Development and is also my current focus, I have been working my way through App Academy's full-stack course, small bits at a time.

The Intro to Programming module focuses on Ruby (not HTML, CSS, jQuery or JavaScript, HAHA!), and on this day, I focused on a few coding challenges.  Based on prior and current exposure to Ruby, I appreciate the simplicity of the language, thus far.
* First challenge:
    *  Wrote a method that accepted an array of words as a parameter and returned a new array containing the words from the original array with an ! added at the end of each word. Joining or adding strings of data together is called _concatenation_, in tech speak. In Ruby, methods are written like this:
    ```Ruby
        #Do you see how simple this is? BTW, this is how you write a comment in Ruby which is ignored when the code is executed
        def method_name
            code goes here
        end
    ``` 
    * Second challenge:
        * Wrote a method that accepted an array of numbers and returned a new array made up of the result of original numbers multiplied by their index or position in the array.
    <br>

    * Third challenge:
        * Wrote an array that accepted as its parameter, a maximum number and retunrned an array consisting of all even numbers from 0 to the maximum number passed to the array.
    <br>

    **Observation**
    To add values to an array use << which in Ruby looks like this:
    ```Ruby
    arr << 2 
    # This will place 2 at the end of the array defined as arr
    ```
