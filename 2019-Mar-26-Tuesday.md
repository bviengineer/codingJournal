# [Jr. Devs Meetup](https://jr-devs.github.io/)
This was my 2nd time attending Jr. Devs meetup.
* __YouTube Presentation__
 We watched [an :boom:__inspirational__:boom: YT video of a presentaiton by a developer who is also a :boom:__mom__:boom: of many](https://youtu.be/xvV7OI1jdu4). She shared her story and the length of time it took her to actually become a working developer. __HINT:__ It wasn't the three months promised by bootcamps.

* __Code Challenge__
We were given a challenge to write a piece of code that reverses a string, in a new language. Since I had already one this in JavaScript and Ruby, possibly in Python too, I wrote this challenge in PHP.
  * [My Repl.it with the code can be found here](https://repl.it/@bviengineer/PeriodicTurboLevel)
