#### JavaScript
I've worked with JavaScript Math.random() method before but today, this challenge seemed a bit confusing. This I will revist during my next theoratical day and will move on once I'm comfortable with the concept.
 ```javascript
//Tutorial Solution
function randomNumberRange(lower, upper){
  return random = Math.floor(Math.random() * (upper - lower)) + lower;  
}

console.log( randomNumberRange(1, 6) );
console.log( randomNumberRange(1, 100) );
console.log( randomNumberRange(200, 500) );
console.log( randomNumberRange(1000, 20000) );
console.log( randomNumberRange(50, 100) );
```

#### Python
Resumed beginning python track and covered:
* Numbers: `int()`, `float()`, `%`, `//` vs `/`
  * `//` returns an integer after a division
  * `/` may return a float or integer after a division
* Strings and operators
* String methods: `len`, `in`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `{}`, `.format()`
* Booleans: `bool()`*
* Quizzes and challenges regarding the above

## [Learn JavaSript]()
* Substrings: `substring(indexStart, indexEnd)`, or `substring(indexStart`
<br>

* Skip first character coding challenge > used `substring(indexStart)` to solve challenge
<br>

* Advanced substring coding challenge > used sub`string(indexStart, indexEnd)` to solve the challenge;

* String concatenation `+`
* String concatenation challenge

## [SoloLearn]()
I had previously completed the JavaScript track on SoloLearn but the platform has since updated the track to include the `ECMAScript 6` standard and thus additional modules to take in order to recomplete the course and gain the JavaScript Fundamentals certificate. 

Completed lessons and quizzes on:
* Loops and functions in ES6
* ES6 objects
  * shorthand notations and computed property names
