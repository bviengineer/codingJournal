## [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
Today I focused on where I left off: FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects: _Build a Tribute Page and Build a Survey Form_.

The [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/qvPdGR) which honors the work of [Garrett A. Morgan](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/qvPdGR) was reworked because I accidentally forked the finished FreeCodeCamp CodePen example instead of the template which included a test suite. This also allowed me to make some additional changes while it was being reworked.

The [Survey From](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/yZqqry) was previously built out and only needed to be styled.

Both the [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/qvPdGR) and [Survey Form](https://codepen.io/bvienigneer/full/yZqqry) can be located on CodePen.
