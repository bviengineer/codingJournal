#### JavaScripts Basics
Resumed and completed the _JavaScript basics_ module. Quite honestly, I've gone through so many variations of JavaScript basics that I am comfortable with the material and if a refersher is ever needed, it will be easy to pickup. 

* **Created a simple program** that generated a random number between the lower and upper limits defined by two arguments, respectively. The program verified that values passed in were `true numbers` and was programmed to throw a developer-defined error if they values were not numbers.  `Math.random()` was the method used to generate the random numbers and `Math.floor()` was used to round-down the results.

#### Imposter Syndrome
* Watched a video on **Imposter Syndrome** which is a real emotion.
  * Lesson reasured that the feeling is real and normal event for seasoned developers. The lesson also encouraged to continue learning.

#### JavaScript Practice Challenges

1. Attach the challenge file: `geometry.js` to the index.html file
`<sricpt src="js/geometry.js"></script>`
<br>

2. Create a function that calculates the **area of a rectangle**
```JavaScript
  /* Instructions:  
    The function should accept the width and height as arguments
    and return the area of that rectangle.
    The area of a rectangle is the width * height 
  */

  function calculate_area(width, height){
    return width * height;
}
```

3. Create a function that calculates the volume of a **rectangular prism**
```JavaScript
  /* Instructions:
    The function should accept the width, height and length as arguments
    and return the volume of that rectangular prism.
    The volume of a rectangular prism is the width * height * length
*/

  function calculate_volume(width, height, length){
    let volume = width * height * length;
    return volume;
  }
```

4. Create a function that calculates the **area of a circle**
```JavaScript
/* Instructions:
    The function should accept the radius of the circle as an argument
    and return the area of that circle.
    The area of a circle is the value of π * radius^2
*/
  
  function area_of_circle(radius){
    let area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
    return area;
  }
```

5. Create a function that calculates the **volume of a sphere**
```JavaScript
/* Instructions:
    The function should accept the radius of the sphere as an argument
    and return the volume.
    The volume of a circle is: 4/3 *  π * radius^3
*/

  function volume_of_sphere(radius){
    let volume = (4/3) * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 3);
    return volume;    
  }
```

6. Use `console.log` to test each function and output to the JavaScript console
```JavaScript
/* Here are the values to test and the expected results
    2. Area of rectangle that is 5 wide and 22 tall: 110
    3. Volume of a rectangular prism that is 4.5 x 12.5 x 17.4: 978.7499999999999
    4. Area of a circle that with a radius of 7.2: 162.8601631620949
    5. Volume of a spehere with a radius of 7.2: 1563.4575663561109
*/

console.log("The area of the rectangle is: ", calculate_area(5, 22));
console.log("The volume of the rectangular prism is: ", calculate_volume(4.5, 12.5, 17.4));
console.log("The area of the circle is: ", area_of_circle(7.2));
console.log("The volume of the sphere is: ", volume_of_sphere(7.2));
```
