### Treeouse
Continued on the topic of semantic markup, noting that ``<main></main>`` should be used only once per page and enclosing content that will not be repeated elsewhere. Examples of what should not be included in between ``<main></main>`` are:
* Navigation
* Footer
* ``<aside></aside>`` content

For content that cannot be described by a semantic tag, using a generic ``<div><div>`` element is acceptable that servces as a container or wrapper for related content. It also aids in controlling the layout of content on a page.
