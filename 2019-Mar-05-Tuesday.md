## [App Academy Open FREE Online Full-Stack Curriculum]() - REVIEW
As mentioned during [my last review day](https://github.com/bviengineer/codingJournal/blob/master/2019-Feb-28.md), it has been two weeks since I last touched the App Academy Curriculum and a result, today was a continued refresher on what I previously learned.
* Variables: 
  * `var_example = 42`
  * `name = 'Student'`
  * ` = ` is the assignment operator while `==` and `===` are equality operators
<br>
* Methods:
  * Methods allow you to run or execute repeative code wihtout having to duplicate the code.
  * Example of a method in Ruby
  ```ruby
    def ruby_method
      # code here...
      puts "I am a Ruby method"
    end

    # Call or execute the method
    ruby_method

    # Output
    "I am a Ruby method"
  ```
  * `def` is short for define
  <br>

 * Method **with parameter**
  ```ruby
    def method_with_parameter(location)
      puts "Hello World from: " + location
    end

    # Calling method & passing it the execpted var as 
    # an argument
    method_with_parameter("Space")

    # Output
    "Hello World from: Space"
  ```
* Conditionals: 
```ruby
  #e.g
  num = 50
  if num > 0
    puts "It is greater than zero"
  elsif num < 0
    puts "It's not greater than zero"
  else
    "It's zero!"
  end

  # Possible combinations
  if
  end

  if
  else
  end

  if
  elsif
  else
  end
```
