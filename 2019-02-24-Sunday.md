## [Treehouse TalentPath]()

#### JavaScripts Basics
Resumed and completed the _JavaScript basics_ module. Quite honestly, I've gone through so many variations of JavaScript basics that I am comfortable with the material and if a refersher is ever needed, it will be easy to pickup. 

* **Created a simple program** that generated a random number between the lower and upper limits defined by two arguments, respectively. The program verified that values passed in were `true numbers` and was programmed to throw a developer-defined error if they values were not numbers.  `Math.random()` was the method used to generate the random numbers and `Math.floor()` was used to round-down the results.

##### Imposter Syndrome
* Watched a video on **Imposter Syndrome** which is a real emotion.
  * Lesson reasured that the feeling is real and normal event for seasoned developers. The lesson also encouraged to continue learning.

##### JavaScript Basics Practice Challenges

1. Attach the challenge file: `geometry.js` to the index.html file
`<sricpt src="js/geometry.js"></script>`
<br>

2. Create a function that calculates the **area of a rectangle**
```JavaScript
  /* Instructions:  
    The function should accept the width and height as arguments
    and return the area of that rectangle.
    The area of a rectangle is the width * height 
  */

  function calculate_area(width, height){
    return width * height;
}
```

3. Create a function that calculates the volume of a **rectangular prism**
```JavaScript
  /* Instructions:
    The function should accept the width, height and length as arguments
    and return the volume of that rectangular prism.
    The volume of a rectangular prism is the width * height * length
*/

  function calculate_volume(width, height, length){
    let volume = width * height * length;
    return volume;
  }
```

4. Create a function that calculates the **area of a circle**
```JavaScript
/* Instructions:
    The function should accept the radius of the circle as an argument
    and return the area of that circle.
    The area of a circle is the value of π * radius^2
*/
  
  function area_of_circle(radius){
    let area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
    return area;
  }
```

5. Create a function that calculates the **volume of a sphere**
```JavaScript
/* Instructions:
    The function should accept the radius of the sphere as an argument
    and return the volume.
    The volume of a circle is: 4/3 *  π * radius^3
*/

  function volume_of_sphere(radius){
    let volume = (4/3) * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 3);
    return volume;    
  }
```

6. Use `console.log` to test each function and output to the JavaScript console
```JavaScript
/* Here are the values to test and the expected results
    2. Area of rectangle that is 5 wide and 22 tall: 110
    3. Volume of a rectangular prism that is 4.5 x 12.5 x 17.4: 978.7499999999999
    4. Area of a circle that with a radius of 7.2: 162.8601631620949
    5. Volume of a spehere with a radius of 7.2: 1563.4575663561109
*/

console.log("The area of the rectangle is: ", calculate_area(5, 22));
console.log("The volume of the rectangular prism is: ", calculate_volume(4.5, 12.5, 17.4));
console.log("The area of the circle is: ", area_of_circle(7.2));
console.log("The volume of the sphere is: ", volume_of_sphere(7.2));
```

#### JavaScript Loops, Arrays and Objects
Completed lessons, quizzes and challenges on `while loops`, `do while loops` and `for loops`. Also refactored some code.
<br>

##### JavaScipt Loops, Arrays and Objects Practice Challenges:
The described challenges below were successfully completed using all three loops: `for loop`, `do while loop` and `while loop`

```JavaScript
// Global Variables as listed in the challenges
let text; //for loop

let i = 0; // do while loop
let text; //do while loop

let i; // while loop
let text; // while loop


/* CHALENGE #1
  Write a: FOR LOOP, DO WHILE LOOP and WHILE LOOP to build a string of
  numbers from 0 to 4, separated by spaces, and store the string in the
  variable `text`.
*/

// for loop
    text = "";
    for(let i = 0; i <= 4; i += 1) {
      text += i + ' ';
    }
    print(text); // OUTPUT: 0 1 2 3 4 


// do while loop  
    text = "";
    do {
      text += i + " ";
      i += 1;

/* BONUS CHALLENGE- DO WHILE & WHILE LOOPS`
  Write a do while loop that builds a string of random integers
  between 0 and 9. Stop building the string when the number 8 comes up.
  Be sure that 8 does print as the last character. The resulting string 
  will be a random length.

// do while loop
    text = "";
    i = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9);
    do {
      i = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9);
      text += i + " ";
    } while(i !== 8)
    print(text); // OUTPUT: [a] completely random number(s) between 0 - 9


// while loop
    text = "";
    while(i !== 8){
      i = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9);
      text += i + " ";
