##[Frontend Mentor Challenges](https://frontendmentor.io)
Worked on the [Intermediate-level huddle landing page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-596348). Chrome Dev tools has been inconsistently displaying the mobile version of the site which has made progress slow. 
Worked on layout of elements on the page. [Here's the page](https://bviengineer.github.io/frontendmentor.io-huddle-landing-page/) and because I'm still working on responsiveness it's best viewed at 375px.
