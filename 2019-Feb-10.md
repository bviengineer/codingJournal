# Deploy Node.js App to Heroku
Successfully relaunched [Node.js Blog App](https://boiling-sierra-65746.herokuapp.com/) on heroku. The link can also be copied and pasted into your browswer window: https://bviengineer.github.io/simple-portfolio-site/.

Next step is to add a link to the app from my current and [simple portfolio site](https://bviengineer.github.io/simple-portfolio-site/).
