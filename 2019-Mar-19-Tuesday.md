* Reviewed enumerable methods
  * `.each` method
    * iterates over each element of an array and eliminates the need to manually : 
      * set & change a counter variable 
      * include a a conditional statement
  ```ruby
    months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"]

    months.each do |ele| puts ele end
                  # OR
    months.each { |ele| puts ele }
    # OUTPUT
    # Jan
    # Feb
    # Mar
    # Apr
  ```

### [Repl.it](https://repl.it)
I use [Repl.it](https://replt.it) to execute code I write while learning and they have a feature that allows you to take classes. To test out how the feature works, I joined one of the classes as a student and selected the `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `JQuery` classroom.

Worked through first HTML handson assigments that covered:
* writing the basic structure of an `HTML` document and include a `<title></title>` with content
<br>

* writing the basick structure of an `HTML` element without the `<head></head>` and with an `<h1></h1>` in the body of the body of the document with content
<br>

* writing an `<ol></ol>` with 6 items
<br>

* create an `<a>` element that links to an external resource
<br>

* create an `<a>` element that links to a different section of the same page
