Today I picked up on my [FeeCodeCamp Build a Prodct landing page](https://github.com/bviengineer/build-a-product-landing-page). Got through the header and most of the content. Will resume the development of the project during my day oo. tomorrow.

The repo is proviate and is thus unsure if you'll be able to see a copy of the page once linked.
