Began with FCC curriculm today. For my daily routine, it's the quickest to review since I only study a predetermined amount of lessons for any given topic and the lessons are short with small challenges (thus far). Still on the _CSS Flexbox_ module, I covered:

* Practiced managing the _flex <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">children</span> containers_ inside the flex parent container using `justify-content` property for the tweet embed.
<br>

* Using the `align-items` property to align _flex <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">children</span> containers_ inside of the parent container.
<br>

* The use of the `flex-wrap` property to wrap a row or column
<br>

* Using `flex-shrink` to dynamically shrink the _flex <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">child</span> containers_ in the event the width of the parent flex container is smaller than the combined width of its children containers.
<br>

* Using `flex-grow` to dynamically expand the size of the _flex <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">child</span> containers_ as the parent flex container grows; the opposite of `flex-shrink`.

## App Academy [free] Full-Stack Curriculm
Began a new module today: <span style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">_Array Methods & Enumerables._</span>

* In going over the **Array Manipulation Methods** lecture, now I remember that Ruby, like JavaScript has an array method named `.push()` for adding, i.e. _pushing_ items to an array. Unlike `<<`, `push()` can put more than one item at a time [the end of] an array. Like, JavaScript, these methods are also available in Ruby:
  ```ruby
    .pop() #remove an item from the END of an array
    .shift() #remove an item from the FRONT of an array
    .unshift() #add an item to the FRONT of an array
  ```
* <span style="color: blue;">Index & Include Methods Lecture</span>
  ```ruby
    .index() #returns the (numerial) index of an item in an array
      #Example
      arr = ["GA", "SC", "FL"]
      puts arr.index("GA") # 0
      puts arr.index("FL") # 2
      puts arr.index("NC") # nothing is returned because the item does not exist in the array

      string = "Lake"
      puts arr.index("ke") #2 since the beginnning of the substring can be found at index 2
      puts arr.index("ked") # nothing is returned since the substring does not exist


      .include?() #returns a boolean value (true or false)
        #Examples
        arr = ["GA", "SC", "FL"]
        puts arr.include?("GA") #true
        puts.arr.include?("NC") #false 
      
        string = "ruby"
        puts arr.include?("R") #false, R & r are not the same
        puts.arr.inclue?("y") #true
        puts.arr.include?("by") #true, this is a substring e.g.

  ```

  ```ruby
    .reverse #changes the order of items in an array without ALTERING the original array
    .reverse! #changes the order of items in array and alters the original array
    #both methods works the same on string variables.

    #Examples
    arr = ["foo" "bar", "index"]
      puts arre #["foo" "bar", "index"] array order before calling the .reverse method 
      
      puts arr.reverse #["index" "bar", "foo"] #reverses the conent in array but doesn't alter it. A new array is made & needs to be returned or saved in a vairiable if it will be used elsewhere

      puts arr #["foo" "bar", "index"] original array remains unchanged after calling .reverse on it  

      puts.arr.reverse!  #["index" "bar", "foo"] reverse! - reverses the order of items & alters the original array

      #the above methods work the same way on string variables
  ```
