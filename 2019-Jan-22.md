Began with FCC curriculm today. For my daily routine, it's the quickest to review since I only study a predetermined amount of lessons for any given topic and the lessons are short with small challenges (thus far). Still on the _CSS Flexbox_ module, I covered:

* Practiced managing the _flex <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">children</span> containers_ inside the flex parent container using `justify-content` property for the tweet embed.
<br>
* Using the `align-items` property to align _flex <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">children</span> containers_ inside of the parent container.
<br>
* The use of the `flex-wrap` property to wrap a row or column
<br>
* Using `flex-shrink` to dynamically shrink the _flex <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">child</span> containers_ in the event the width of the parent flex container is smaller than the combined width of its children containers.
<br>
* Using `flex-grow` to dynamically expand the size of the _flex <span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">child</span> containers_ as the parent flex container grows; the opposite of `flex-shrink`.
